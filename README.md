1.  **The Problem**: Highlighting the environmental issue the product addresses.
2.  **The Solution**: Presenting EcoSwap as the answer.
3.  **How It Works**: A simple explanation of the product's process.
4.  **Call to Action**: A final prompt for the user to get started.

The implementation focuses on creating a delightful user experience through fluid animations and a clean interface.
